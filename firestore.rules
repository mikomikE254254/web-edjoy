/**
 * This ruleset enforces a security model for a retail product catalog.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The primary goal is to allow any user to browse the catalog freely while enabling
 * administrators to manage products during development. Write access is currently
 * open for prototyping purposes and MUST be secured before production.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores individual product details.
 * - /products/{productId}/reviews/{reviewId}: Stores user-specific ratings.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Stores category information.
 * - /styles/{styleId}: Stores style information.
 * - /orders/{orderId}: Stores customer order information.
 * This flat structure is performant and simplifies security rules.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All documents are publicly readable to allow the app's front-end
 *   to function for all visitors.
 * - Open Write Access (for Prototyping): For development, write operations on products,
 *   categories, styles, reviews and orders are allowed (`if true;`). This is insecure and must be
 *   replaced with role-based access control before launch.
