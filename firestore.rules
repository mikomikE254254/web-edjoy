/**
 * This ruleset enforces a security model for a retail product catalog.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The primary goal is to allow any user to browse the catalog freely while enabling
 * administrators to manage products during development. Write access is currently
 * open for prototyping purposes and MUST be secured before production.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Stores individual product details.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Stores category information.
 * This flat structure is performant and simplifies security rules.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All documents in both `/products` and `/categories` are publicly
 *   readable and listable to allow the app's front-end to function for all visitors.
 * - Open Write Access (Products): For development, all write operations on the `/products`
 *   collection are allowed (`if true;`). This enables the admin dashboard to function
 *   without a full authentication system. This is insecure and must be replaced with
 *   role-based access control before launch.
 * - Category Writes Disabled: Write access to `/categories` remains disabled, as there
 *   is currently no UI to manage them.
